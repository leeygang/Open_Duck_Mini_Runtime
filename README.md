## Raspberry Pi zero 2W setup

### Install Raspberry Pi OS

Download Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) from here : https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/

Follow the instructions here to install the OS on the SD card : https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html

With the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can pre-configure session, wifi and ssh. Do it like below :

> Tip: I configure the rasp to connect to my phone's hotspot, this way I can connect to it from anywhere.

### Setup SSH (If not setup during the installation)

When first booting on the rasp, you will need to connect a screen and a keyboard. The first thing you should do is connect to a wifi network and enable SSH.

To do so, you can follow this guide : https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-up-wifi

Then, you can connect to your rasp using SSH without having to plug a screen and a keyboard.

###Â Update the system and install necessary stuff

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-virtualenvwrapper
```

Add this to the end of the `.bashrc`:

```bash
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

### Enable UART

First disable the shell over serial. Run `sudo raspi-config`, navigate to `Interface Options`, then `Serial Port`, and select `No`, then `Yes`.

Then, edit the file `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and add the following line at the end of the file :

```
enable_uart=1
```

### Set the usbserial latency timer

```bash
cd  /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo touch 99-usb-serial.rules
sudo nano 99-usb-serial.rules
# copy the following line in the file
SUBSYSTEM=="usb-serial", DRIVER=="ftdi_sio", ATTR{latency_timer}="1"
```

### Set the udev rules for the motor control boards

## Install the runtime

### Make a virtual environment and activate it 

```bash
mkvirtualenv -p python3 open-duck-mini-runtime
workon open-duck-mini-runtime
```

Clone this repository on your rasp, cd into the repo, then :

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Test the IMU

```bash
cd scripts/
python imu_test.py
```
